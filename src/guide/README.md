In the `install` directory of the repository there is a script that was made in shell that is responsible for installing Docker, Git and if you want to directly configure the Github user and email.

In this way, you only have to execute:

* Using bash
```
bash install_tools.sh
```

Using shell

```
./install_tools.sh
```
